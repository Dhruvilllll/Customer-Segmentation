# Customer Segmentation

This project aims to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographics using K-Means clustering.

**1. Data:**

* ["https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python"]

**2. Data Preprocessing:**

* **Data Cleaning:** 
    * Handled missing values.
    * Addressed outliers.
* **Feature Engineering:**
    * Created new features based on existing data (Customer Lifetime Value and Purchase Frequency).
    * Selected relevant features for clustering.
* **Data Scaling:**
    * Standardized or normalized the selected features to ensure that all features have a similar scale.

**3. K-Means Clustering:**

* Implemented the K-Means clustering algorithm.
* Determined the optimal number of clusters using methods like the elbow method or silhouette analysis.
* Assigned each customer to a specific cluster.

**4. Cluster Analysis:**

* Analyzed the characteristics of each customer segment.
* Identified key differences between customer segments in terms of their demographics, purchasing behavior, and other relevant factors.

**5. Technologies Used:**

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn

**6. Results and Visualization:**
